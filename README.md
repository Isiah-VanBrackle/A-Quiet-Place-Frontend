# A-Quiet-Place-Frontend

A Quiet Place is a single-page web application primarily designed to allow a user to keep track of the books in their library. Users may also search for cafe's or bookstores near them in which to relax, read, and acquire more books.

# Getting Started
To begin you'll want to clone down both this Frontend repository and the Backend. The instructions below will focus on getting the Frontend up and running, but you may wish to completely set up the backend first to avoid a "server in use error."

# Installing
1. Open up your text editor's terminal and cd into a-quiet-place
2. Once in that folder, run 'bundle install' our gem-file is up to date so you shouldn't need to install any new gems
3. Run run 'npm install' then 'npm start'
4. Now the application should open, you'll be greeted by a home page, but unless you've already set up the backend you won't be able to create a new account.
5. If you don't wish to make a new account but you'd still like to see the apps functionality you can log in with the Username: Generic, the password for this account is '123'
